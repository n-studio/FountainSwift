<div id='script-title'><p class='title'>Big Fish</p><p class='credit'>written by</p><p class='authors'>John August</p><p class='source'>based on the novel by Daniel Wallace</p></div><p class='page-break'>1.</p>
<p class='action'>This is a Southern story, full of lies and fabrications, but truer for their inclusion.</p>
</section>
<section>
<p class='page-break'>2.</p>
<p class='action'><strong>FADE IN:</strong></p>
<p class='action'>A RIVER.</p>
<p class='action'>We’re underwater, watching a fat catfish swim along.</p>
<p class='action'>This is The Beast.</p>
<p class='character'>EDWARD (V.O.)</p>
<p class='dialogue'>There are some fish that cannot be caught.  It’s not that they’re faster or stronger than other fish.  They’re just touched by something extra.  Call it luck.  Call it grace.  One such fish was The Beast.</p>
<p class='action'>The Beast’s journey takes it past a dangling fish hook, baited with worms.  Past a tempting lure, sparkling in the sun.  Past a swiping bear claw.  The Beast isn’t worried.</p>
<p class='character'>EDWARD (V.O.)(CONT’D)</p>
<p class='dialogue'>By the time I was born, he was already a legend.  He’d taken more hundred-dollar lures than any fish in Alabama. Some said that fish was the ghost of Henry Walls, a thief who’d drowned in that river 60 years before.   Others claimed he was a lesser dinosaur, left over from the Cretaceous period.</p>
<p class='scene-heading'>INT.  WILL’S BEDROOM - NIGHT (1973)</p>
<p class='action'>WILL BLOOM, AGE 3, listens wide-eyed as his father EDWARD BLOOM, 40’s and handsome, tells the story.  In every gesture, Edward is bigger than life, describing each detail with absolute conviction.</p>
<p class='character'>EDWARD</p>
<p class='dialogue'>I didn't put any stock into such speculation or superstition.  All I knew was I’d been trying to catch that fish since I was a boy no bigger than you.</p>
<p class='parenthetical'>(closer)</p>
<p class='dialogue'>And on the day you were born, that was the day I finally caught him.</p>
<p class='page-break'>3.</p>
</section>
<section>
<p class='scene-heading'>EXT.  CAMPFIRE - NIGHT (1977)</p>
<p class='action'>A few years later, and Will sits with the other INDIAN GUIDES as Edward continues telling the story to the tribe.</p>
<p class='character'>EDWARD</p>
<p class='dialogue'>Now, I’d tried everything on it:  worms, lures, peanut butter, peanut butter-and-cheese.  But on that day I had a revelation:  if that fish was the ghost of a thief, the usual bait wasn’t going to work.  I would have to use something he truly desired.</p>
<p class='action'>Edward points to his wedding band, glinting in the firelight.</p>
<p class='character'>LITTLE BRAVE</p>
<p class='parenthetical'>(confused)</p>
<p class='dialogue'>Your finger?</p>
<p class='action'>Edward slips his ring off.</p>
<p class='character'>EDWARD</p>
<p class='dialogue'>Gold.</p>
<p class='action'>While the other boys are rapt with attention, Will looks bored.  He’s heard this story before.</p>
<p class='character'>EDWARD</p>
<p class='dialogue'>I tied my ring to the strongest line they made -- strong enough to hold up a bridge, they said, if just for a few minutes -- and I cast upriver.</p>
<p class='scene-heading'>INT.  BLOOM FRONT HALL - NIGHT (1987)</p>
<p class='action'>Edward is chatting up Will’s pretty DATE to the homecoming dance.  She is enjoying the story, but also the force of Edward’s charisma.  He’s hypnotizing.</p>
<p class='character'>EDWARD (CONT’D)</p>
<p class='dialogue'>The Beast jumped up and grabbed it before the ring even hit the water.  And just as fast, he snapped clean through that line.</p>
<p class='page-break'>4.</p>
<p class='action'>WILL, now 17 with braces, is fuming and ready to leave.  His mother SANDRA -- from whom he gets his good looks and practicality -- stands with him at the door.</p>
<p class='character'>EDWARD</p>
<p class='dialogue'>You can see my predicament.  My wedding ring, the symbol of fidelity to my wife, soon to be the mother of my child, was now lost in the gut of an uncatchable fish.</p>
<p class='action'>ON WILL AND SANDRA</p>
<p class='character'>WILL</p>
<p class='parenthetical'>(low but insistent)</p>
<p class='dialogue'>Make him stop.</p>
<p class='action'>His mother pats him sympathetically, then adjusts his tie.</p>
<p class='character'>WILL’S DATE</p>
<p class='dialogue'>What did you do?</p>
<p class='character'>EDWARD</p>
<p class='dialogue'>I followed that fish up-river and down-river for three days and three nights, until I finally had him boxed in.</p>
<p class='action'>Will regards his father with exasperated contempt.</p>
<p class='character'>EDWARD</p>
<p class='dialogue'>With these two hands, I reached in and snatched that fish out of the river.  I looked him straight in the eye.  And I made a remarkable discovery.</p>
<p class='scene-heading'>INT.  TINY PARIS RESTAURANT (LA RUE 14°) - NIGHT (1998)</p>
<p class='action'>WILL, now 28, sits with his gorgeous bride JOSEPHINE.  This is their wedding reception, crowded with their friends and family.  They should be joyful, but Will is furious.</p>
<p class='action'>Edward has the floor, ostensibly for a toast.  The room is cozy and drunk.</p>
<p class='page-break'>5.</p>
<p class='character'>EDWARD</p>
<p class='dialogue'>This fish, the Beast.  The whole time we were calling it a him, when in fact it was a her.  It was fat with eggs, and was going to lay them any day.</p>
<p class='action'>Over near the doorway, we spot Sandra, just returned from the restrooms.  She looks gorgeous.  She couldn’t be any happier if this were her own wedding.</p>
<p class='character'>EDWARD</p>
<p class='dialogue'>Now, I was in a situation.  I could gut that fish and get my ring back, but doing so I would be killing the smartest catfish in the Ashton River, soon to be mother of a hundred others.</p>
<p class='action'>Will can’t take any more.  Josephine tries to hold him back, but he gets up and leaves.  Edward doesn’t even notice.</p>
<p class='character'>EDWARD (CONT’D)</p>
<p class='dialogue'>Did I want to deprive my soon-to-be-born son the chance to catch a fish like this of his own?  This lady fish and I, well, we had the same destiny.</p>
<p class='action'>As he leaves, Will mutters in perfect unison with his father--</p>
<p class='character'>EDWARD AND WILL</p>
<p class='dialogue'>We were part of the same equation.</p>
<p class='action'>Will reaches the door, where his mother intercepts him.</p>
<p class='character'>SANDRA</p>
<p class='dialogue'>Honey, it’s still your night.</p>
<p class='action'>Will can’t articulate his anger.  He just leaves.</p>
<p class='character'>EDWARD</p>
<p class='dialogue'>Now, you may well ask, since this lady fish wasn’t the ghost of a thief, why did it strike so quick on gold when nothing else would attract it?</p>
<p class='parenthetical'>(closer; he holds up his ring)</p>
<p class='dialogue'>That was the lesson I learned that day, the day my son was born.</p>
<p class='page-break'>6.</p>
<p class='action'>He focuses his words on Sandra.  This story is -- and has always been -- about her more than anyone.</p>
<p class='character'>EDWARD</p>
<p class='dialogue'>Sometimes, the only way to catch an uncatchable woman is to offer her a wedding ring.</p>
<p class='action'>A LAUGH from the crowd.</p>
<p class='action'>Edward motions for Sandra to get up here with him.  As she crosses, we can see that thirty years of marriage has not lessened their affection for each other.</p>
<p class='action'>As they kiss, Edward tweaks her chin a special little way.  The crowd APPLAUDS.</p>
<p class='action'>Edward toasts the happy couple.  Josephine covers well for her absent husband, a smile as warm as summer.</p>
<p class='action'>Edward downs his champagne in a gulp.</p>
<p class='scene-heading'>EXT.  OUTSIDE LA RUE 14° - NIGHT</p>
<p class='action'>We come into the middle of an argument on the sidewalk.  Occasional PASSERSBY take notice, especially as it gets more heated.  Both men are a little drunk.</p>
<p class='character'>EDWARD</p>
<p class='dialogue'>What, a father’s not allowed to talk about his son?</p>
<p class='character'>WILL</p>
<p class='parenthetical'>(disbelieving)</p>
<p class='dialogue'>I am a footnote in that story.  I am the context for your great adventure.  Which never happened!  Incidentally!  You were selling novelty products in Wichita the day I was born.</p>
<p class='character'>EDWARD</p>
<p class='parenthetical'>(shaking his head)</p>
<p class='dialogue'>Jesus Christ.</p>
<p class='character'>WILL</p>
<p class='dialogue'>Friend of yours?  Did you help him out of a bind?</p>
<p class='character'>EDWARD</p>
<p class='dialogue'>Come on, Will.  Everyone likes that story.</p>
<p class='page-break'>7.</p>
<p class='character'>WILL</p>
<p class='dialogue'>No Dad, they don’t.  <u>I</u> do not like the story.  Not anymore, not after a <u>thousand</u> <u>times</u>.  I know all the punchlines, Dad.  I can tell them as well as you can.</p>
<p class='parenthetical'>(closer)</p>
<p class='dialogue'>For one night, one night in your entire life, the universe does not revolve around Edward Bloom.  It revolves around me and my wife.  How can you not understand that?</p>
<p class='action'>A long beat, then...</p>
<p class='character'>EDWARD</p>
<p class='parenthetical'>(low)</p>
<p class='dialogue'>Sorry to embarrass you.</p>
<p class='action'>Will won’t let him get the last word.</p>
<p class='character'>WILL</p>
<p class='dialogue'>You’re embarrassing yourself, Dad.  You just don’t see it.</p>
<p class='action'>ANGLE ON Edward.  Fine.  A hand to wave, enough of you.</p>
<p class='action'>He walks away.</p>
<p class='action'>ANGLE ON Will, still fuming with righteous anger.  It’s then we FREEZE FRAME.</p>
<p class='character'>WILL (V.O.)(CONT’D)</p>
<p class='dialogue'>After that night, I didn’t speak to my father again for three years.</p>
<p class='scene-heading'>INT.  A.P. NEWSROOM (PARIS) - DAY</p>
<p class='action'>A typically busy day.  On hold with the phone cradled under an ear, Will sorts through a bundle of mail dropped on his desk.</p>
<p class='character'>WILL (ON PHONE)</p>
<p class='parenthetical'>(without pauses)</p>
<p class='dialogue'>William Bloom with the Associated Press if I could just...</p>
<p class='action'>He’s put back on hold.  Returning to the mail, he finds a hand-addressed envelope.  Rips it open.</p>
<p class='page-break'>8.</p>
<p class='character'>WILL (V.O.)(CONT’D)</p>
<p class='dialogue'>We communicated indirectly I guess.  In her letters and Christmas cards, my mother would write for both of them.</p>
<p class='scene-heading'>INT.  BLOOM HOUSE KITCHEN - DAY</p>
<p class='action'>At the table, Sandra talks on the phone while Edward fixes a sandwich.</p>
<p class='character'>WILL (V.O.)</p>
<p class='dialogue'>When I’d call, Mom would say that Dad was out driving.  Or swimming in the pool.</p>
<p class='action'>Edward takes a seat, starting to eat his sandwich.</p>
<p class='character'>WILL (V.O.) (CONT'D)</p>
<p class='dialogue'>True to form, we never talked about our not talking.</p>
<p class='scene-heading'>INT.  BLOOM HOUSE MASTER BEDROOM - NIGHT</p>
<p class='action'>Sandra stands by the window, watching as...</p>
<p class='scene-heading'>EXT.  BLOOM BACK YARD - NIGHT [CONTINUOUS]</p>
<p class='action'>Edward swims laps in the family pool.  He’s born to the water.</p>
<p class='character'>WILL (V.O.)</p>
<p class='dialogue'>The truth is, I didn’t see anything of myself in my father, and I don’t think he saw anything of himself in me.  We were like strangers who knew each other very well.</p>
<p class='scene-heading'>EXT.  RIVER - DAY</p>
<p class='action'>Edward stares intently into the water, a lion in wait.</p>
<p class='page-break'>9.</p>
<p class='character'>WILL (V.O.)</p>
<p class='dialogue'>In telling the story of my father’s life, it’s impossible to separate the fact from the fiction, the man from the myth.  The best I can do is to tell it the way he told me.</p>
<p class='action'>We LOOK DOWN at the river, where Edward’s reflection is caught in the dark water.  As the water ripples past, something changes.</p>
<p class='action'>Sure enough, as we LOOK UP again, it’s a younger EDWARD BLOOM, 20’s, staring into the water.  He’s not just handsome, not just charming.  It’s as if all the forces of the natural world had conspired to create him.</p>
<p class='character'>WILL (V.O.) (CONT’D)</p>
<p class='dialogue'>It doesn’t always make sense, and most of it never happened.</p>
<p class='action'>Suddenly, this Edward thrusts both hands into the water, grabbing hold of</p>
<p class='action'>THE BEAST.</p>
<p class='action'>He brings the catfish up to his face.  Looks it right in the eye.  A beat, then the Beast spits out Edward’s gold ring.</p>
<p class='character'>WILL (V.O.) (CONT’D)</p>
<p class='dialogue'>But that’s what kind of story this is.</p>
<p class='action'>Smiling, Edward takes the ring, then throws the Beast back into the water with a splash.</p>
<p class='action'>TITLE OVER:</p>
<p class='action center'><u>BIG FISH</u></p>
<p class='scene-heading'>INT.  HOSPITAL ROOM - DAY</p>
<p class='action'>Young Dr. Bennett stands between the Wife’s legs.  She’s flustered and sweating, but the doctor has a comforting bedside manner...</p>
<p class='character'>YOUNG DR. BENNETT</p>
<p class='dialogue'>Now, Mrs. Bloom, I’ll need you to give me one good push.  On three.  One...</p>
<p class='page-break'>10.</p>
<p class='action'>Suddenly, we hear a POP as a slimy mass of human being rockets into the doctor’s unprepared hands.  Bennett tries to hold tight, but the infant is slippery like a fish.  It shoots up into air.</p>
<p class='action'>The NURSES and the Husband try to grab the baby, but no one can hold it.  As the newborn sails upward TOWARDS CAMERA, we can see a GIGGLING SMILE on its face.</p>
<p class='action'>As it falls, the newborn knocks over a tray, which provides it a ramp to slide right out of the room.  Everyone races after it.</p>
<p class='scene-heading'>INT.  HOSPITAL HALLWAY - DAY</p>
<p class='action'>Bursting through the doors --</p>
<p class='character'>YOUNG DR. BENNETT</p>
<p class='dialogue'>Grab that baby!</p>
<p class='action'>A NURSE finally scoops up the slippery baby.  Everyone lets out a collective sigh of relief.</p>
<p class='character'>WILL (V.O.)</p>
<p class='dialogue'>My father’s birth would set the pace for his unlikely life.  No longer than most men’s, but larger.  And as strange as his stories got, the endings were always the most surprising of all.</p>
<p class='scene-heading'>INT.  HALF-DARK PARIS APARTMENT - (PRESENT) DAY</p>
<p class='action'>Over the sound of rain, a phone RINGS on a chair.  By the tone of the ring, we know we’re not in the U.S. -- it has that insistent European sound.</p>
<p class='action'>As it keeps RINGING, we look to see the apartment is mostly empty, just a few half-unpacked boxes.  A cradle is still in its carton.</p>
<p class='action'>KEYS in the lock.  LAUGHTER in the hallway.  The door swings open to reveal a drenched Will (29) carrying four sacks of groceries, the bottoms collapsing from the rain.  His wife Josephine (28) pushes past him to get the phone.</p>
<p class='character'>JOSEPHINE</p>
<p class='dialogue'>Allo oui?</p>
<p class='page-break'>11.</p>
<p class='action'>Will begins stripping out of his wet clothes, each layer unleashing a new drizzle.  He plays it up, trying to get a reaction out of Josephine.</p>
<p class='character'>JOSEPHINE (CONT’D)</p>
<p class='parenthetical'>(on phone)</p>
<p class='dialogue'>Yes, he’s here.</p>
<p class='action'>She hands the phone to Will, concerned.</p>
<p class='character'>JOSEPHINE (CONT’D)</p>
<p class='dialogue'>It’s your mother.</p>
<p class='action'>Half-stripped, Will takes the phone.  This won’t be good news.</p>
<p class='character'>WILL</p>
<p class='parenthetical'>(on phone)</p>
<p class='dialogue'>Hi.  Uh-huh.  Uh-huh.</p>
<p class='action'>As Josephine takes off her rain coat, we see she is very, very pregnant.  She listens carefully to Will’s side of the conversation, trying to gauge how bad the news is.</p>
<p class='character'>WILL (CONT’D)</p>
<p class='dialogue'>What does Dr. Bennett say?  Okay.  No, sure, let me talk to him.   I’ll wait.</p>
<p class='action'>He covers the mouthpiece.  Looks over to Josephine.</p>
<p class='character'>JOSEPHINE</p>
<p class='dialogue'>It’s bad.</p>
<p class='character'>WILL</p>
<p class='dialogue'>It’s more than they thought.  They’re going to stop chemo.</p>
<p class='character'>JOSEPHINE</p>
<p class='dialogue'>You need to go.</p>
<p class='character'>WILL</p>
<p class='dialogue'>Probably tonight.</p>
<p class='action'>A beat.</p>
<p class='character'>JOSEPHINE</p>
<p class='dialogue'>I’m going with you.</p>
<p class='character'>WILL</p>
<p class='dialogue'>You don’t have to.</p>
<p class='page-break'>12.</p>
<p class='character'>JOSEPHINE</p>
<p class='parenthetical'>(a simple fact)</p>
<p class='dialogue'>I’m going with you.</p>
<p class='scene-heading'>INT.  AIR FRANCE 747 - NIGHT</p>
<p class='action'>As the plane continues boarding, a STEWARDESS recites the welcome spiel in French.  Will has a window seat in coach.  Josephine sits beside him, putting on hand lotion.</p>
<p class='action'>Taking his hands, she rubs the excess into him.  There's an effortless intimacy between them.  She can pinpoint what he's feeling before he can.</p>
<p class='scene-heading'>INT.  747 / FLYING - NIGHT</p>
<p class='action'>Hours later, and the lights are dimmed.  Most of the PASSENGERS are asleep, including Josephine.  Her head is propped against Will’s shoulder, her hands tucked under her belly.</p>
<p class='action'>Will watches her sleep, brushing back her hair.  A beat, then he notices a BORED BOY in the next row over.</p>
<p class='action'>Off the glow of the reading light, the boy is using his hands to cast shadows on the seat back.   The kid is pretty good, making a convincing bird, a passable monkey, and finally a dog.</p>
<p class='action'>We PUSH IN on the silhouettes.</p>
<p class='character'>EDWARD (O.S., PRELAP)</p>
<p class='dialogue'>So which one’s it gonna be?  The Monkey in the Barn, the Dog in the Road?</p>
<p class='action'>Focusing on the final shadow, we...</p>
<p class='transition'>MATCH CUT TO:</p>
<p class='scene-heading'>INT.  BLOOM HOUSE - NIGHT</p>
<p class='action'>...come to find Edward making the shapes.</p>
<p class='action'>Will (6) sits in his pajamas on the floor next to him.  The endtable lamp lies between them, its shade off to cast big shadows on the wall.</p>
<p class='character'>WILL</p>
<p class='dialogue'>The one about the witch.</p>
<p class='page-break'>13.</p>
<p class='character'>EDWARD</p>
<p class='dialogue'>Your mom says I can’t tell you that one anymore.  You get nightmares.</p>
<p class='character'>WILL</p>
<p class='dialogue'>I’m not scared.</p>
<p class='action'>Edward looks around for a beat, seeing if his wife is in earshot.  He then leans in, complicitous.</p>
<p class='character'>EDWARD</p>
<p class='dialogue'>Neither was I.  At first.</p>
<p class='action'>Will smiles, excited to hear the forbidden story.</p>
<p class='character'>EDWARD (CONT’D)</p>
<p class='dialogue'>This all happened in the swamp outside of Ashton.  Kids weren’t supposed to go out in the swamp, on account of the snakes and spiders and quicksand that would swallow you up before you could even scream.  But there were five of us out there that night:  Me, Ruthie, Wilbur Freely, and the Price Brothers, Don and Zacky.</p>
<p class='action'>Edward holds up his hand, counting the names on his fingers.</p>
<p class='character'>EDWARD (CONT’D)</p>
<p class='dialogue'>Not a one of us knew what was in store.</p>
<p class='action'>As his hand moves past the light, we</p>
<p class='transition'>COME TO:</p>
<p class='action'>A flashlight SWEEPS past.  We are...</p>
<p class='scene-heading'>EXT.  FIELD AT THE SWAMP EDGE - NIGHT</p>
<p class='action'>The night is WHIRRING and BREATHING, alive.  The moon hangs low, casting long shadows.</p>
<p class='action'>Five kids walk past in silhouette.  Four have flashlights on.  The fifth keeps tripping, crashing into YOUNG EDWARD (10).</p>
<p class='character'>EDWARD</p>
<p class='dialogue'>Zacky, turn your flashlight on!</p>
<p class='page-break'>14.</p>
<p class='character'>ZACKY</p>
<p class='dialogue'>I don’t got any batteries!</p>
<p class='action'>Red-headed ZACKY PRICE is 10.  His brother DON PRICE is 12, and a lot bigger than the others.</p>
<p class='character'>DON PRICE</p>
<p class='dialogue'>Then why’d you bring it?</p>
<p class='character'>ZACKY</p>
<p class='dialogue'>I don’t want to be in the swamp with a witch and no flashlight.</p>
<p class='action'>WILBUR FREELY, also 10, is the black asthmatic son of a sharecropper.  Redheaded RUTHIE MACKLIN, 8, is happy just to be there.</p>
<p class='character'>EDWARD</p>
<p class='dialogue'>Is it true she got a glass eye?</p>
<p class='character'>WILBUR FREELY</p>
<p class='dialogue'>I heard she got it from Gypsies.</p>

<p class='scene-heading'>EXT.  A CREEPY OLD HOUSE - NIGHT</p>
<p class='character'>ADULT EDWARD (V.O.)</p>
<p class='dialogue'>Now, it’s common knowledge that most towns of a certain size have a witch, if only to eat misbehaving children and the occasional puppy who wanders into her yard.  Witches use those bones to cast spells and curses that make the land infertile.</p>
<p class='action'>We PULL BACK, and BACK, revealing more of the Gothically creepy house:  its broken windows, strangling vines, and eerie gargoyles half-buried in the dirt.  Even bats are afraid to fly over it.</p>
<p class='action'>In the moonlight, the house is especially sinister.  Who knows what is lurking in the shadows?</p>
<p class='character'>ADULT EDWARD (V.O.)(CONT’D)</p>
<p class='dialogue'>Yet of the all the witches in Alabama, there was one who was the most feared.  For she had one glass eye, which was said to contain mystical powers.</p>
<p class='action'>We finally come to the kids, staring in through the gate.</p>
<p class='character'>WILBUR FREELY</p>
<p class='dialogue'>I hear if you look right at it, you can see how you’re gonna die.</p>
<p class='character'>EDWARD</p>
<p class='dialogue'>That’s bull-s-h-i-t, that is.  She’s not even a real witch.</p>
<p class='character'>DON PRICE</p>
<p class='dialogue'>You’re so sure, why don’t you go in and get that eye?  I heard she keeps it in a box on her nighttable.</p>
<p class='action'>Edward looks back at the spooky house.</p>
<p class='character'>DON PRICE (CONT’D)</p>
<p class='dialogue'>Or are you too scared?</p>
<p class='character'>EDWARD</p>
<p class='dialogue'>I’ll go in right now and get that eye.</p>
<p class='page-break'>16.</p>
<p class='character'>DON PRICE</p>
<p class='dialogue'>Then do it.</p>
<p class='character'>EDWARD</p>
<p class='dialogue'>Fine, I will.</p>
<p class='character'>DON PRICE</p>
<p class='dialogue'>Fine, you do it.</p>
<p class='character'>EDWARD</p>
<p class='dialogue'>Fine, I’m doing it.</p>
<p class='action'>He hands Zacky his flashlight, then starts climbing the gate.</p>
<p class='character'>RUTHIE</p>
<p class='dialogue'>Edward, don’t!</p>
<p class='character'>WILBUR FREELY</p>
<p class='dialogue'>She’ll make soap out of you!</p>
<p class='parenthetical'>(to Ruthie)</p>
<p class='dialogue'>That’s what she does, she makes soap out of people.</p>
<p class='action'>Edward drops down on the far side of the gate.  Truth be told, Edward is scared, but he forges ahead anyway.</p>
<p class='action'>Wilbur looks to Ruthie, and they’re in complete agreement.  They get the hell out of there.  Zacky would run too, but Don holds him by the collar.</p>
<p class='scene-heading'>EXT. APPROACHING THE HOUSE</p>
<p class='action'>Edward curves around the tall bushes that hide the front door.  Anything could jump out of them.</p>
<p class='action'>He steps on the porch.  The boards SQUEAL and CREAK, but he continues on.  A cat SCREAMS OUT from a broken wicker rocker.  Catching his breath, Edward reaches the front door.</p>
<p class='action'>The doorknob is ancient brass, two projections that look like horns.  Yet Edward extends his hand, reaching closer and closer before he finally</p>
<p class='action'>RINGS THE DOORBELL.</p>
<p class='action'>Impossibly fast, the door opens, revealing an OLD WOMAN with a patch over her left eye.  She looks like she’s been dead for years, but too stubborn to lie down.</p>
<p class='page-break'>17.</p>
<p class='character'>EDWARD</p>
<p class='parenthetical'>(calm and straightforward)</p>
<p class='dialogue'>Ma’am, my name is Edward Bloom, and there’s some folks’d like to see your eye.</p>

<p class='action'>Zacky and Don Price wait for Edward, each moment more convinced he’s already dead.  But suddenly, he’s back at the gate.</p>

<p class='dialogue'>You get the eye?</p>
<p class='character'>EDWARD</p>
<p class='dialogue'>I brought it.</p>
<p class='character'>DON PRICE</p>
<p class='parenthetical'>(dubious)</p>
<p class='dialogue'>Let’s see it.</p>
<p class='action'>The Old Woman steps out of the shadows behind Edward, flipping up her eye patch.  When their flashlight beam hits her left eye, it shines with a hellish glow.</p>

<p class='action'>Don and Zacky both tremble with fear.  The latter has tears in his eyes.</p>
<p class='character'>ZACKY</p>
<p class='dialogue'>I saw how I was gonna die.  I was old, and I fell.</p>
<p class='character'>DON PRICE</p>
<p class='dialogue'>I wasn’t old at all.</p>
<p class='action'>The brothers suddenly bolt.  Still standing next to the Old Woman, Edward smiles.</p>
<p class='scene-heading'>EXT.  AT THE OLD WOMAN’S DOOR - NIGHT</p>
<p class='action'>Edward helps her back inside.  He could leave now, but curiosity gets the better of him.</p>
<p class='character'>EDWARD</p>
<p class='dialogue'>I was thinking about death and all.  About seeing how you’re gonna die.</p>
<p class='action'>The Old Woman turns to him slightly, still not facing him.</p>
<p class='character'>EDWARD (CONT’D)</p>
<p class='dialogue'>I mean, on one hand, if dying was all you thought about, it could kind of screw you up.  But it could kind of help you, couldn’t it?  Because you’d know that everything else you can survive.</p>
<p class='action'>The Old Woman smiles a little, a crooked grin of broken teeth.</p>
<p class='character'>EDWARD (CONT’D)</p>
<p class='dialogue'>I guess I’m saying, I’d like to know.</p>
<p class='action'>The Old Woman turns leaning her face right in front of his.  And on a silent count of one, two, three -- Edward looks into The Eye.</p>
<p class='action'>This time we don’t cut.  Instead, we HOLD ON Edward as he witnesses his death.  He stares transfixed, perplexed and amused.  Whatever he sees, it’s not as dire as the other boys.  His future has something strange in store.</p>
<p class='page-break'>19.</p>
<p class='character'>EDWARD (CONT’D)</p>
<p class='dialogue'>Huh.  That’s how I go?</p>
<p class='action'>The Old Woman nods.  Still a little overwhelmed, Edward turns and leaves.</p>
<p class='character'>ADULT EDWARD (V.O.)</p>
<p class='dialogue'>From that moment on, I no longer feared death.  And for that, I was as good as immortal.</p>
<p class='action'>As Edward leaves, the door swings SHUT on its own.</p>
<p class='transition'>MATCH CUT TO:</p>
<p class='scene-heading'>INT./EXT.  BLOOM HOUSE - (PRESENT) DAY</p>
<p class='action'>The front door opens to reveal Will and Josephine on the porch with their bags.  REVERSE to Will’s mother Sandra (53), surprised and a little annoyed.</p>
<p class='character'>SANDRA</p>
<p class='dialogue'>How did you get here?</p>
<p class='character'>WILL</p>
<p class='dialogue'>We swam.  The Atlantic, it’s not that big really.</p>
<p class='character'>SANDRA</p>
<p class='dialogue'>Ruth McHibbon offered to pick you up at the airport.</p>
<p class='character'>WILL</p>
<p class='dialogue'>We rented a car.</p>
<p class='character'>SANDRA</p>
<p class='parenthetical'>(simply)</p>
<p class='dialogue'>You didn’t need to do that.  You just didn’t.</p>
<p class='action'>A beat.  Starting over...</p>
<p class='character'>WILL</p>
<p class='dialogue'>Hi, Mom.</p>
<p class='action'>He leans in and hugs her.  She surrenders, squeezing her son tight.  Will and his mother are cut from the same cloth -- strong-willed but practical.  They’ve always been close.</p>
<p class='character'>SANDRA</p>
<p class='dialogue'>I’m so glad you’re here.</p>
<p class='page-break'>20.</p>
<p class='action'>That hug finished, Sandra pushes past her son to her daughter-in-law.  Seeing the size of her belly --</p>
<p class='character'>SANDRA</p>
<p class='dialogue'>You shouldn’t have flown.  But...</p>
<p class='action'>They hug.</p>
<p class='character'>JOSEPHINE</p>
<p class='dialogue'>It’s good to see you.  You look beautiful.</p>
<p class='action'>It’s not flattery.  It’s the truth.</p>
<p class='character'>SANDRA</p>
<p class='dialogue'>Thank you.  I’ll bet you need to --</p>
<p class='character'>JOSEPHINE</p>
<p class='dialogue'>Yes.</p>
<p class='character'>SANDRA</p>
<p class='dialogue'>Down the hall on the right.  The door sticks.  You have to really pull it.</p>
<p class='action'>Josephine squeezes past, a smile to her husband -- be nice.  Will heads back to the rental car to retrieve luggage.  Sandra follows him.</p>
<p class='action'>Coming down the driveway, we get to see the house for the first time:  an older suburban home, three bedrooms, big for the neighborhood, and nicely grown into the lot.  KIDS are playing on the street.</p>
<p class='character'>WILL</p>
<p class='dialogue'>Is that Dr. Bennett’s car?</p>
<p class='character'>SANDRA</p>
<p class='dialogue'>He’s up with your father.</p>
<p class='action'>Heading back to the house...</p>
<p class='character'>WILL</p>
<p class='dialogue'>How is he?</p>
<p class='character'>SANDRA</p>
<p class='dialogue'>He’s impossible.  He won’t eat.   And because he won’t eat, he gets weaker.  And because he’s weaker, he doesn’t want to eat.</p>
<p class='page-break'>21.</p>
<p class='character'>WILL</p>
<p class='dialogue'>How much time does he have left?</p>
<p class='character'>SANDRA</p>
<p class='dialogue'>You don’t talk about those things.  Not yet.</p>
<p class='scene-heading'>INT.  KITCHEN - DAY</p>
<p class='action'>Sandra is pouring iced tea for Will and Josephine.</p>
<p class='action'>DR. JULIUS BENNETT (85) enters from the foyer, still winded from coming down the stairs.  He was the town’s first Black physician.  He’s still the town’s best physician.</p>
<p class='character'>DR. BENNETT</p>
<p class='dialogue'>Will.</p>
<p class='character'>WILL</p>
<p class='dialogue'>Dr. Bennett.  It’s good to see you.</p>
<p class='parenthetical'>(they shake)</p>
<p class='dialogue'>My wife, Josephine.</p>

<p class='action'>He leans close to her, whispering in her ear...</p>
<p class='character'>DR. BENNETT</p>
<p class='dialogue'>It’s a boy.</p>
<p class='action'>She smiles, surprised but not doubting.  Will looks over -- what did he say?  Josephine shakes her head.</p>
<p class='action'>Back to the main subject...</p>
<p class='character'>SANDRA</p>
<p class='dialogue'>You don’t think he looks any worse.</p>
<p class='character'>DR. BENNETT</p>
<p class='dialogue'>No.  I would say he’s the same.</p>
<p class='page-break'>22.</p>
<p class='action'>And in the silence that follows, a lot is said.  It wasn’t the upbeat reply Sandra was hoping for.</p>
<p class='character'>WILL</p>
<p class='dialogue'>Can I see him?</p>
<p class='character'>DR. BENNETT</p>
<p class='dialogue'>Absolutely.  Be good for you to talk to him.</p>
<p class='action'>A moment of awkwardness -- everyone here knows they haven’t spoken in years.</p>
<p class='action'>Sandra hands Will a squat can of Ensure from the case on the counter.</p>
<p class='character'>SANDRA</p>
<p class='dialogue'>Get him to drink one of these.  He won’t, but tell him he has to.</p>
<p class='scene-heading'>INT.  FOYER - DAY</p>
<p class='action'>Coming out from the kitchen, Will slowly climbs the stairs.  They CREAK with every step.</p>
<p class='action'>The wall is filled with family photos, happier times.  Most of the pictures are of Will, starting when he was an infant and ending at his wedding.  As he climbs the stairs, we can see him growing up with every step.</p>
<p class='scene-heading'>INT.  UPSTAIRS HALLWAY - DAY</p>
<p class='action'>A crack of sunlight spills around the half-open door at the end of the hallway.  Will walks towards it, running a hand along the wallpaper.</p>
<p class='action'>Almost at the door, he stops for a beat.  Gets his breath.  Then goes inside.</p>
<p class='scene-heading'>INT.  GUEST ROOM - DAY</p>
<p class='action'>Edward Bloom, 61, lies asleep on the bed.  Although he’s not the vibrant man we’ve seen before, it’s not as bad we feared.  The illness has been quick, and left him largely intact.</p>
<p class='action'>There are no I.V.’s, no monitors, nothing.</p>
<p class='action'>Coming up to the bed --</p>
<p class='page-break'>23.</p>
<p class='character'>WILL</p>
<p class='dialogue'>Dad?</p>
<p class='action'>Edward cracks open an eye, a beat before he focuses.  He tries to say something, but no words come out.</p>
<p class='action'>He looks over at a pitcher on the nightstand.  Will pours him a glass of water, helping him hold it to his parched lips.</p>
<p class='action'>Finished, Edward sets down the glass by himself.  A very long, tense beat.  Will almost speaks again to fill the silence.</p>
<p class='action'>Finally...</p>
<p class='character'>EDWARD</p>
<p class='dialogue'>You --</p>
<p class='parenthetical'>(he points)</p>
<p class='dialogue'>-- are in for a surprise.</p>
<p class='character'>WILL</p>
<p class='dialogue'>Am I?</p>
<p class='character'>EDWARD</p>
<p class='dialogue'>Having a kid changes everything.  I mean, there’s the diapers and the burping and the midnight feedings...</p>
<p class='character'>WILL</p>
<p class='dialogue'>Did you do any of that?</p>
<p class='character'>EDWARD</p>
<p class='dialogue'>No, but I hear it’s terrible.  Then you spend years trying to corrupt and mislead this child, fill its head with nonsense and still it turns out perfectly fine.</p>
<p class='character'>WILL</p>
<p class='dialogue'>You think I’m up for it?</p>
<p class='character'>EDWARD</p>
<p class='dialogue'>You learned from the best.</p>
<p class='action'>Will doesn’t rise to the challenge.  A beat, then he remembers the can of Ensure.  Holds it up.  Edward recoils.</p>
<p class='character'>WILL</p>
<p class='dialogue'>Just drink half the can.  I’ll tell her you drank the whole thing.  Everyone wins.</p>
<p class='page-break'>24.</p>
<p class='action'>A beat, then Edward rolls his eyes.  Fine.  Will cracks open the can, finding a straw on the nightstand.</p>
<p class='character'>EDWARD</p>
<p class='dialogue'>People needn’t worry so much.  It’s not my time yet.  This isn’t how I go.</p>
<p class='character'>WILL</p>
<p class='dialogue'>Really.</p>
<p class='character'>EDWARD</p>
<p class='dialogue'>Truly.  I saw it in The Eye.</p>
<p class='character'>WILL</p>
<p class='dialogue'>The Old Lady by the swamp.</p>
<p class='character'>EDWARD</p>
<p class='dialogue'>She was a witch.</p>
<p class='character'>WILL</p>
<p class='dialogue'>No, she was old and probably senile.  Maybe schizophrenic.</p>
<p class='character'>EDWARD</p>
<p class='dialogue'>I saw my death in that eye.  And this is not how it happens.</p>
<p class='character'>WILL</p>
<p class='dialogue'>So how does it happen?</p>
<p class='character'>EDWARD</p>
<p class='dialogue'>Surprise ending.  Wouldn’t want to ruin it for you.</p>
<p class='action'>Edward slurps down as much of the Ensure as he can stand, then pushes the can away.  He swallows with difficulty.</p>
<p class='character'>EDWARD (CONT’D)</p>
<p class='dialogue'>There was this panhandler who used to stop me every morning when I came out of this coffee shop near the office.</p>
<p class='character'>WILL</p>
<p class='dialogue'>Okay.</p>
<p class='character'>EDWARD</p>
<p class='dialogue'>And every day I gave him a quarter.  Every day.  Then I got sick and was out for a couple of weeks.  And when I went back there, you know what he said?</p>
<p class='page-break'>25.</p>
<p class='character'>WILL</p>
<p class='dialogue'>What did he say?</p>
<p class='character'>EDWARD</p>
<p class='dialogue'>You owe me three-fifty.</p>
<p class='character'>WILL</p>
<p class='dialogue'>Really.</p>
<p class='character'>EDWARD</p>
<p class='dialogue'>True story.</p>
<p class='action'>A beat.</p>
<p class='character'>WILL</p>
<p class='dialogue'>When did you ever work in an office?</p>
<p class='character'>EDWARD</p>
<p class='dialogue'>There’s a lot you don’t know about me.</p>
<p class='character'>WILL</p>
<p class='dialogue'>You’re right.</p>
<p class='action'>Edward gives a wry smile.  He walked into that.</p>
<p class='character'>EDWARD</p>
<p class='dialogue'>Your mother was worried we wouldn’t talk again.  And look at us.  We’re talking fine.  We’re storytellers, both of us.  I speak mine out, you write yours down.  Same thing.</p>
<p class='action'>Will won’t commit to Edward’s assessment.</p>
<p class='character'>WILL</p>
<p class='dialogue'>Dad, I’m hoping we can talk about some things while I’m here.</p>
<p class='character'>EDWARD</p>
<p class='dialogue'>You mean, while <u>I’m</u> here.</p>
<p class='character'>WILL</p>
<p class='dialogue'>I’d just like to know the true versions of things.  Events.  Stories.  You.</p>
<p class='action'>Edward LAUGHS a little, which becomes a COUGH.  The HACKING escalates until another drink of water gets it under control.  It’s not clear whether any of this was an act to keep from talking.</p>
<p class='page-break'>26.</p>

<p class='dialogue'>You know where the chemicals are?</p>
<p class='character'>WILL</p>
<p class='dialogue'>I used to do it when you were gone, remember?  I used to do it a lot.</p>
<p class='action'>He didn’t mean for that to sound so pointed.  Taking the half-empty Ensure, Will gets up to go.  He’s at the door when...</p>
<p class='character'>EDWARD</p>
<p class='dialogue'>I was never much for being at home, Will.  It’s too confining.  And this, here.  Being stuck in bed.  Dying is the worst thing that ever happened to me.</p>
<p class='action'>He smiles at his joke.</p>
<p class='character'>WILL</p>
<p class='dialogue'>I thought you weren’t dying.</p>
<p class='character'>EDWARD</p>
<p class='dialogue'>I said this isn’t how I go.  The last part is much more unusual.  Trust me on that.</p>
<p class='scene-heading'>INT.  UPSTAIRS HALLWAY - DAY</p>
<p class='action'>Shutting the door behind himself, Will drinks the rest of the Ensure himself.  Edward was right.  It tastes horrible.</p>
<p class='action'>Heading for the stairs, Will walks past an open door.  As he leaves frame, we STAY BEHIND to look inside...</p>
<p class='scene-heading'>INT.  WILL’S BEDROOM - DAY  [FLASHBACK]</p>

<p class='action'>Suddenly, his voice CRACKS and DROPS a half-octave.  And then another.  His friends Wilbur Freeley and Ruthie look over, wondering what’s wrong.  Embarrassed, Edward just keeps SINGING, trying to follow along with the baritone part.</p>
<p class='action'>He pulls at his collar.  Then pulls again, his face getting red.  Starting to panic, he loosens his tie.  He’s starting to undo the collar button when it POPS off by itself.  Two more buttons fly off.  One hits a CHUBBY WOMAN in the neck.</p>
<p class='action'>ON HIS SHOES</p>
<p class='action'>As we watch, Edward’s pant cuffs rise inch by inch -- that’s how fast he’s growing.</p>

<p class='character'>EDWARD (V.O.)</p>
<p class='dialogue'>My muscles couldn’t keep up with my bones, and my bones couldn’t keep up with my body’s ambition.  So I spent the better part of three years confined to my bed, with the World Book Encyclopedia being my only means of exploration.  I had made it all the way to the “G’s,” hoping to find an answer to my gigantificationism, when I uncovered an article about the common goldfish.</p>
<p class='action'>INSERT:  The encyclopedia article, complete with drawings.</p>
<p class='character'>YOUNG EDWARD</p>

<p class='action'>Young Edward thinks this through.</p>
<p class='character'>EDWARD (V.O.)</p>
<p class='dialogue'>It occurred to me then, that perhaps the reason for my growth was that I was intended for larger things.  After all, a giant man can’t have an ordinary-sized life.</p>

<p class='scene-heading'>INT.  HIGH SCHOOL STAGE - DAY</p>
<p class='action'>A dashingly handsome Edward leads the CAST out for a curtain call.  He’s the star of the show.  Off to the side, we see Don Price is the ass-end of a horse costume.</p>
<p class='action'>Edward soaks in his applause, smiling and gracious.</p>
<p class='scene-heading'>EXT.  GRADUATION STAGE - DAY</p>
<p class='action'>Edward accepts his diploma.  The PRINCIPAL hugs him tight.</p>
<p class='character'>EDWARD (V.O.)</p>
<p class='dialogue'>I was the biggest thing Ashton had ever seen.  Until one day, a stranger arrived.</p>
<p class='scene-heading'>EXT.  FARM - DAY</p>
<p class='action'>As two FARMERS shake their heads, we REVERSE to a show a massive hole punched through the side of a barn.  It’s roughly the shape of man, but no human could be that large.</p>
<p class='scene-heading'>EXT.  SHEEP PEN - DAY</p>
<p class='action'>Two fat ewes look up, a shadow falling across them.  They BLEAT in panic as</p>
<p class='action'>TWO OVERSIZED HANDS</p>
<p class='action'>reach in and scoop them up.  Their protests continue as they’re carried away, one under each arm.  We still haven’t seen the full stranger.</p>
<p class='scene-heading'>EXT.  COURT HOUSE - DAY</p>
<p class='action'>A MOB of about 50 have gathered, many of them with shotguns.  Amid the crowd we see Don Price.</p>
<p class='character'>SHARECROPPER</p>
<p class='dialogue'>He ate an entire cornfield!</p>
<p class='character'>LITTLE GIRL</p>
<p class='dialogue'>He ate my dog!</p>
<p class='character'>HOT-BLOODED SHOTGUN TOTER</p>
<p class='dialogue'>If you ain’t gonna stop him Mayor, we will!</p>
<p class='page-break'>31.</p>
<p class='character'>MAYOR</p>
<p class='dialogue'>I won’t have mob violence in this town.  Now, has someone tried talking to him?</p>
<p class='character'>SOME FARMER</p>
<p class='dialogue'>You can’t reason with ‘im!</p>
<p class='character'>SHEPHARD</p>
<p class='dialogue'>He’s a monster!</p>
<p class='action'>Agreement from the crowd.  And then...</p>
<p class='character'>A VOICE (O.S.)</p>
<p class='dialogue'>I’ll do it.</p>
<p class='action'>Everyone turns to see who said that.  The crowd parts to reveal none other than Edward Bloom.  Don Price glowers.</p>
<p class='character'>EDWARD</p>
<p class='dialogue'>I’ll talk to him.  See if I can get him to move on.</p>
<p class='character'>MAYOR</p>
<p class='dialogue'>Son, that creature could crush you without trying.</p>
<p class='character'>EDWARD</p>
<p class='dialogue'>Trust me, he’ll have to try.</p>
<p class='scene-heading'>EXT.  HILL OUTSIDE ASHTON - DAY</p>
<p class='action'>Edward climbs up the last bit of the steep hillside, reaching the mouth of a cave.  Outside, buzzards squabble over the remains of the giant’s feast:  broken barrels, bones picked clean.</p>
<p class='action'>In his most serious voice, Edward calls out:</p>
<p class='character'>EDWARD</p>
<p class='dialogue'>Hello!</p>
<p class='action'>There’s no answer.</p>
<p class='character'>EDWARD  (CONT’D)</p>
<p class='dialogue'>My name is Edward Bloom!  I want to talk to you!</p>
<p class='action'>From deep in a cave, a thunderous voice:</p>
<p class='character'>VOICE (O.S.)</p>
<p class='dialogue'>GO AWAY!</p>
<p class='page-break'>32.</p>
<p class='action'>The giant’s voice has such force, it blows Edward’s hair back.</p>
<p class='character'>EDWARD</p>
<p class='dialogue'>I’m not going anywhere until you show yourself.</p>
<p class='action'>A beat, then we hear a RUMBLE, like a train coming.  Edward braces himself, fists ready for a fight, if that’s what it’s going to take.</p>
<p class='action'>As the RUMBLE gets louder, the ground starts to shake.  Even Edward starts to worry.  Just how big is this guy?</p>
<p class='character'>EDWARD (V.O.)(CONT’D)</p>
<p class='dialogue'>Armed with the foreknowledge of my own death, I knew the giant couldn’t kill me.  All the same, I preferred to keep my bones unbroken.</p>
<p class='action'>Edward picks up a stone, ready to play David to Goliath.</p>
<p class='action'>Then suddenly, the giant bursts forth.  Hunched over, he slams into a stunned Edward, knocking him halfway down the hill.</p>
<p class='action'>KARL THE GIANT is bigger than any man you’ve ever seen.  Not just tall, but massive.  He’s completely feral, with a beard to his elbow and skin scratched and blistered.  What remains of his clothes are ragged and muddy.  God knows what’s living in his matted hair.</p>
<p class='action'>Karl leans over Edward, blocking the sun.  Edward throws his rock, but it just bounces off.  The giant didn’t even notice it.</p>
<p class='character'>KARL</p>
<p class='dialogue'>Why are you here?</p>
<p class='action'>Edward ponders the best response, settling on...</p>
<p class='character'>EDWARD</p>
<p class='dialogue'>So you can eat me.  The town decided to send a human sacrifice, and I volunteered.</p>
<p class='action'>Karl’s eyes narrow, confused.  Edward stands up.</p>
<p class='page-break'>33.</p>
<p class='character'>EDWARD (CONT’D)</p>
<p class='dialogue'>My arms are a little stringy, but there’s some good eating on my legs.  I mean, I’d be tempted to eat them myself.</p>
<p class='parenthetical'>(beat)</p>
<p class='dialogue'>So I guess, just, if you could get it over with quick.  Because I’m not much for pain, really.</p>
<p class='action'>Edward closes his eyes, hands at his side, ready to be eaten.  Karl just stares at him, not sure what to do.</p>
<p class='action'>After a beat, Edward opens his eyes a tiny bit, just to see what the giant is doing.  Relieved to see he’s not licking his chops --</p>
<p class='character'>EDWARD (CONT’D)</p>
<p class='dialogue'>Look, I can’t go back.  I’m a human sacrifice.  If I go back, everyone will think I’m a coward.  And I’d rather be dinner than a coward.</p>
<p class='action'>Karl sits down with a BOOM, dejected.</p>
<p class='character'>EDWARD (CONT’D)</p>
<p class='dialogue'>Here, start with my hand.  It’ll be an appetizer.</p>
<p class='action'>Reaching up, Edward shoves his hand into Karl’s mouth.  But the giant spits it back out.</p>
<p class='character'>KARL</p>
<p class='dialogue'>I don’t want to eat you.  I don’t want to eat anybody.  It’s just I get so hungry.  I’m too big.</p>
<p class='action'>And that’s the sad truth.  Karl is less a monster than a freak -- a giant man, but in the end, just a man.</p>
<p class='action'>Edward takes a seat beside him.</p>
<p class='character'>EDWARD</p>
<p class='dialogue'>Did you ever think maybe you’re not too big?  Maybe this town’s just too small.  I mean, look at it.</p>
<p class='action'>Circling behind them, we look down at Ashton -- a tiny town in a tiny valley.</p>
<p class='page-break'>34.</p>
<p class='character'>EDWARD (CONT’D)</p>
<p class='dialogue'>Hardly two stories in the whole place.  Now I’ve heard in real cities, they’ve got buildings so tall you can’t even see the tops of ‘em.</p>
<p class='character'>KARL</p>
<p class='dialogue'>Really?</p>
<p class='character'>EDWARD</p>
<p class='dialogue'>Wouldn’t lie to you.  And they’ve got all-you-can-eat buffets.  You can eat a lot, can’t you?</p>
<p class='character'>KARL</p>
<p class='dialogue'>I can.</p>
<p class='character'>EDWARD</p>
<p class='dialogue'>So why are you wasting your time in a small town?  You’re a big man.  You should be in the big city.</p>
<p class='action'>Karl smiles, but then it fades.  A certain sad suspicion --</p>
<p class='character'>KARL</p>
<p class='dialogue'>You’re just trying to get me to leave, aren’t you?  That’s why they sent you here.</p>
<p class='character'>EDWARD</p>
<p class='dialogue'>What’s your name, Giant?</p>
<p class='character'>KARL</p>
<p class='dialogue'>Karl.</p>
<p class='character'>EDWARD</p>
<p class='dialogue'>Mine’s Edward.  And truthfully, I do want you to leave, Karl.  But I want to leave with you.</p>
<p class='parenthetical'>(closer)</p>
<p class='dialogue'>You think this town is too small for you, well, it’s too small for a man of my ambition.  I can’t see staying here a day longer.</p>
<p class='character'>KARL</p>
<p class='dialogue'>You don’t like it?</p>
<p class='page-break'>35.</p>
<p class='character'>EDWARD</p>
<p class='dialogue'>I love every square inch of it.  But I can feel the edges closing in on me.  A man’s life can only grow to a certain size in a place like this.</p>
<p class='parenthetical'>(beat)</p>
<p class='dialogue'>So what do you say?  Join me?</p>
<p class='action'>Karl thinks a moment.  Then --</p>
<p class='character'>KARL</p>
<p class='dialogue'>Okay.</p>
<p class='character'>EDWARD</p>
<p class='dialogue'>Okay.</p>
<p class='action'>They shake on it.</p>
<p class='character'>EDWARD (CONT’D)</p>
<p class='dialogue'>Now first, we gotta get you ready for the city.</p>
<p class='scene-heading'>EXT.  RIVER - DAY</p>
<p class='action'>IN A SINGLE SHOT, Karl cuts his hair with hedge clippers, while Edward cuts up a surplus army tent to make him a shirt.</p>
<p class='scene-heading'>EXT.  MAIN STREET OF ASHTON - DAY</p>
<p class='action'>Spirits buoyed by the high school MARCHING BAND, all the good CITIZENS of Ashton are gathered to see off Edward and Karl.  There’s a few tears amid the familiar faces.</p>
<p class='character'>MAYOR</p>
<p class='parenthetical'>(loudly, for the crowd)</p>
<p class='dialogue'>Edward Bloom, first son of Ashton, it’s with a heavy heart we see you go.  But take with you this Key to the City, and know that any time you want to come back, all our doors are open to you.</p>
<p class='action'>Edward ducks a bit so the Mayor can put the key around his neck.  The crowd CHEERS.  And with that, Edward and Karl start walking, waving as they go.</p>
<p class='action'>Only DON PRICE, smoking on the corner, isn’t sad to see Edward go.  He crushes his cigarette under his heel.  He wishes he could crush Edward.</p>
<p class='page-break'>36.</p>
<p class='action'>Many of the townfolk come onto the street to hug Edward or shake his hand.</p>
<p class='character'>EDWARD (V.O.)</p>
<p class='dialogue'>That afternoon as I left Ashton, everyone seemed to have advice.</p>
<p class='character'>VARIOUS TOWNFOLK</p>
<p class='dialogue'>Find yourself a nice girl!  Don’t trust anyone in Kentucky!  Watch your pride, Edward Bloom!</p>
<p class='character'>EDWARD (V.O.)</p>
<p class='dialogue'>But there was one person whose counsel I held above all others.</p>
<p class='action'>As the crowd parts, he finds himself face to face with</p>
<p class='action'>THE OLD WOMAN.</p>
<p class='action'>The ruckus slows and quiets, as if a strange spell has been cast.  She motions for Edward to lean down, so she can whisper something to him.  Although we’re VERY CLOSE, we can’t hear her voice.</p>
<p class='character'>EDWARD (V.O.) (CONT’D)</p>
<p class='dialogue'>She said that the biggest fish in the river gets that way by never being caught.</p>
<p class='action'>The advice only succeeds in confusing Edward.</p>
<p class='character'>EDWARD (CONT’D)</p>
<p class='parenthetical'>(to the Old Woman)</p>
<p class='dialogue'>Okay.  Thanks.</p>
<p class='action'>Edward and Karl keep walking.  The Old Woman shuffles off, somehow knowing her advice will go unheeded.</p>
<p class='character'>KARL</p>
<p class='dialogue'>What did she say?</p>
<p class='character'>EDWARD</p>
<p class='dialogue'>Beats me.</p>
<p class='scene-heading'>EXT.  ROAD - DAY</p>
<p class='action'>We TILT UP from the road to reveal Edward and Karl walking out of Ashton.  Each wears a backpack with all his earthly possessions.</p>
<p class='page-break'>37.</p>
<p class='character'>EDWARD (V.O.)</p>
<p class='dialogue'>There were two roads out of Ashton, a new one which was paved, and an older one that wasn’t.  People didn’t use the old road anymore, and it had developed the reputation of being haunted.</p>
<p class='action'>Edward and Karl come to a bend, where the paved road veers left and an overgrown dirt road runs straight.  The old road is blocked with signs and warnings of danger.</p>
<p class='character'>EDWARD (V.O.) (CONT’D)</p>
<p class='dialogue'>Since I had no intention of ever returning to Ashton, this seemed as good a time as any to find out what lay down that old road.</p>
<p class='action'>Karl looks at the dirt road, wary.</p>
<p class='character'>KARL</p>
<p class='dialogue'>You know anyone’s who’s taken it?</p>
<p class='character'>EDWARD</p>
<p class='dialogue'>That poet, Norther Winslow did.  He was going to Paris, France.  He must have liked it, because no one ever heard from him again.</p>
<p class='parenthetical'>(beat)</p>
<p class='dialogue'>Tell you what.  You take the other way and I’ll cut through here.  Meet you on the far side.</p>
<p class='action'>A little paranoid...</p>
<p class='character'>KARL</p>
<p class='dialogue'>You’re not trying to run away?</p>
<p class='character'>EDWARD</p>
<p class='dialogue'>Just to be sure, you can take my pack.</p>
<p class='action'>Karl perks up, even though it means more for him to carry.</p>
<p class='scene-heading'>EXT.  DIRT ROAD - DAY</p>
<p class='action'>The road is overgrown, but not altogether creepy.  The sun is still shining, and the birds still CHIRPING.</p>
<p class='action'>Spinning the Key to the City, Edward WHISTLES, because it’s a day meant for whistling.</p>
<p class='page-break'>38.</p>
</section>
<section>
<p class='scene-heading'>EXT. FURTHER ALONG - ROUGH PATH</p>
<p class='action'>The road has narrowed to a rough path.  Spikes of sunlight break through the thick canopy, catching particles in the air.  Still, Edward WHISTLES.</p>
<p class='action'>Coming around a bend, his PITCH DROPS as he sees thick, thorny vines growing across the path.  He stops.  For the first time, he realizes the birds have stopped singing.  The forest is dead quiet.</p>
<p class='action'>He looks back the way he came.  It’s tempting to go back.  It would be easier to go back.  But Edward presses on.</p>
<p class='action'>He carefully steps through the thorns.  His trouser legs catch on the barbs.  We can hear the fabric TEAR.</p>
<p class='action'>FURTHER ALONG</p>
<p class='action'>A scratched and sweaty Edward waves off various STINGING BUGS flying at him, finally whipping off his hat to swat at them.  Just then a CAWING crow swoops down and grabs the hat right out of his hands.</p>
<p class='character'>EDWARD</p>
<p class='dialogue'>You stupid sonofa...</p>
<p class='action'>He stops his swearing, but grabs a rock and throws it.  The stone ricochets off a tree and into a BEE’S NEST.  The swarm roars out.</p>
<p class='action'>Edward high-tails it, each step still precarious.</p>
<p class='scene-heading'>EXT.  THE DARK FOREST - DAY [LATER]</p>
<p class='action'>Edward is bruised, battered and bee-stung.</p>
<p class='action'>A half-broken sign lies in the road.  Edward picks it up.  Reads it:</p>
<p class='action'>WARNING!</p>
<p class='action'>JUMPING SPIDERS!</p>
<p class='action'>Sure enough, up ahead he sees the path is overgrown with thick cobwebs, heavy from the rain.</p>
<p class='page-break'>39.</p>
<p class='character'>EDWARD (V.O.)</p>
<p class='dialogue'>There comes a point where a reasonable man will swallow his pride and admit he’s made a terrible mistake.  The truth is, I was never a reasonable man.</p>
<p class='action'>Edward tosses the sign and forges ahead, into the spiderwebs.</p>
<p class='character'>EDWARD (CONT’D)</p>
<p class='dialogue'>And what I recalled of Sunday School was that the more difficult something became, the more rewarding it was in the end.</p>
<p class='scene-heading'>EXT.  CLEARING / THE ROAD - DAY</p>
<p class='action'>Edward emerges from the forest, brushing the last cobwebs off and shaking the spiders from his shirt.  One is stuck in his sleeve, and he has to dance to get it out.  Even then, he still keeps twitching, convinced another one is left behind.</p>
<p class='action'>At his feet, the gravel road has returned, smooth and dusty and comforting.</p>
<p class='action'>Ahead lies a tiny one-street town -- smaller even than Ashton -- with powerlines emerging from the woods to feed it.  Dangling from the line above he sees two dozen pairs of shoes, their laces tied together.</p>
<p class='action'>He passes a sign that reads “Welcome To Spectre!”</p>
<p class='scene-heading'>EXT.  THE TOWN OF SPECTRE   - DAY</p>
<p class='action'>It’s a main street with stores on each side:  Cole’s Pharmacy, Talbot’s Five and Dime, Al’s Country Store.  Everything is old, but this isn’t a ghost town.  In fact, there’s a group of about 20 CITIZENS spilling out to see Edward approach.  Most are smiling.  There are even a few tears of joy.</p>
<p class='action'>What’s more, all of these people are barefoot.</p>
<p class='character'>MAN’S VOICE</p>
<p class='dialogue'>Friend!</p>
<p class='page-break'>40.</p>
<p class='action'>A forty-year old man named BEAMEN comes out of the seed store to greet Edward.  Friendly but a little drunk, he’s the closest thing the town has to a mayor.  He’s carrying a clipboard.</p>
<p class='character'>BEAMEN</p>
<p class='dialogue'>Welcome to ya.  What’s your name?</p>
<p class='character'>EDWARD</p>
<p class='dialogue'>Edward Bloom.</p>
<p class='action'>Beamen checks the clipboard.  Not finding the name, he flips forward a few pages.  Still looking...</p>
<p class='character'>BEAMEN</p>
<p class='dialogue'>Bloom like a flower?</p>
<p class='character'>EDWARD</p>
<p class='dialogue'>Yes.</p>
<p class='character'>BEAMEN</p>
<p class='dialogue'>Oh.  Here!  Right here.  Edward Bloom.  We weren’t expecting you yet.</p>
<p class='action'>Still confused...</p>
<p class='character'>EDWARD</p>
<p class='dialogue'>You were expecting me?</p>
<p class='character'>BEAMEN</p>
<p class='dialogue'>Not yet.</p>
<p class='action'>A helpful woman named MILDRED chimes in:</p>
<p class='character'>MILDRED</p>
<p class='dialogue'>You must have taken a shortcut.</p>
<p class='character'>EDWARD</p>
<p class='dialogue'>I did.  It nearly killed me.</p>
<p class='character'>BEAMEN</p>
<p class='dialogue'>Mmm-hmm.  Life’ll do that to you.  And truthfully, the long way <u>is</u> easier, but it’s longer.</p>
<p class='character'>MILDRED</p>
<p class='dialogue'>Much longer.</p>
<p class='character'>BEAMEN</p>
<p class='dialogue'>And you’re here now, and that’s what matters.</p>
<p class='page-break'>41.</p>
<p class='action'>Beamen’s daughter JENNY (8) hides behind her father, peering around to look at the handsome stranger.</p>
<p class='character'>EDWARD</p>
<p class='dialogue'>What is this place?</p>
<p class='character'>BEAMEN</p>
<p class='dialogue'>The town of Spectre.  Best kept secret in Alabama.   Says here you’re from Ashton, right?  Last person we had from Ashton was Norther Winslow.</p>
<p class='character'>EDWARD</p>
<p class='dialogue'>The poet?  What ever happened to him?</p>
<p class='character'>BEAMEN</p>
<p class='dialogue'>He’s still here.  Let me buy you a drink.  I’ll tell you all about it.  Hell, I’ll have him tell you.</p>
<p class='character'>EDWARD</p>
<p class='dialogue'>No.  I’ve gotta meet somebody.  I’m already running late.</p>
<p class='action'>He didn’t mean it as a joke, but for some reason, everyone’s laughing.</p>
<p class='character'>BEAMEN</p>
<p class='dialogue'>Son, I already told you.  You’re early.</p>
<p class='scene-heading'>INT.   BEAMEN’S HOUSE - DAY</p>
<p class='action'>Sitting at the kitchen table, Edward takes a second slice of apple pie.  He and Beamen are joined by NORTHER WINSLOW (30), who fancies himself a cultured artist, though he’s never left the state.</p>
<p class='character'>BEAMEN</p>
<p class='dialogue'>Now tell me if that isn’t the best pie you ever ate.</p>
<p class='character'>EDWARD</p>
<p class='dialogue'>It truly is.</p>
<p class='action'>UNDER THE TABLE</p>
<p class='action'>Young Jenny is stealthily untying the laces on Edward’s shoes.</p>
<p class='page-break'>42.</p>
<p class='character'>NORTHER WINSLOW</p>
<p class='dialogue'>Everything here tastes better.  Even the water is sweet.  Never gets too hot, too cold, too humid.  At night the wind goes through the trees and you’d swear there was a whole symphony out there, playing just for you.</p>
<p class='action'>Suddenly, Jenny YANKS OFF Edward’s shoes.  She races for the door.</p>
<p class='character'>EDWARD</p>
<p class='dialogue'>Hey!</p>
<p class='action'>He chases after her.</p>
<p class='scene-heading'>EXT.  TOWN / MAIN STREET - DAY</p>
<p class='action'>As she runs, Jenny ties Edward’s laces together.  Reaching the edge of town, she tosses the shoes up and around the power line -- a perfect throw.  There’s no way he’s ever getting them down.</p>
<p class='action'>The gathered citizens of Spectre CHEER for Edward, who is confused and overwhelmed.  The women hug him.  Men shake his hand.</p>
<p class='action'>Still focused on his shoes...</p>
<p class='character'>EDWARD</p>
<p class='dialogue'>Wait!  I need those!</p>
<p class='character'>NORTHER WINSLOW</p>

<section>
<p class='scene-heading'>EXT.  BY THE RIVER - NIGHT</p>
<p class='action'>By the light of the full moon, Edward soaks his feet in the water, trying to make sense of it all.  The Key to the City dangles around his neck.</p>
<p class='action'>He stares at himself in the reflection.  He smiles.</p>
<p class='action'>It’s then that a WOMAN emerges at the far side of the river.  No telling where she came from -- she must have been swimming underwater.  We never see her face.</p>
<p class='action'>She stands in the river with her bare back to Edward, squeezing the water out of her golden hair, oblivious to his presence.  Edward is breathless.  It’s the first woman he’s seen in her natural state, and he doesn’t dare move lest he frighten her away.</p>
<p class='action'>Then he sees the snake.</p>
<p class='action'>It’s a cottonmouth, has to be.  It leaves a break in the water, its small reptilian head aiming for her flesh.  There’s no decision to be made.  On pure instinct, Edward dives in.  He swims as hard as can,</p>
<p class='action'>GRABBING THE SNAKE</p>
<p class='action'>just as it’s about to strike.</p>
<p class='action'>The woman dives back underwater, understandably terrified that a man is coming at her.</p>
<p class='character'>EDWARD</p>
<p class='dialogue'>No, it’s okay!  I got it.  I got the snake.</p>
<p class='action'>As the splashing subsides, Edward looks at what he holds in his hands.  Which isn’t a snake at all, but rather a common stick.  And a non-threatening one at that.</p>
<p class='action'>While Edward ponders his mistake, he looks around to discover that the Girl in the River is gone.  He never even saw her face.</p>
<p class='character'>EDWARD (CONT’D)</p>
<p class='dialogue'>Wait!  I’m sorry.  Hello?!</p>
<p class='action'>Edward keeps expecting her to surface, somewhere, but she never does.  He stands alone in the river, wondering what tricks his eyes are playing on him.</p>

<p class='action'>The whole town is there in celebration of its newest citizen, Edward Bloom.  Before he can protest, two WOMEN have grabbed him by the arms, pulling him in to dance with them.</p>
<p class='action'>The resulting dance number seems both choreographed and complete chaos.  From FARMER to BAKER’S WIFE, everyone wants to dance with Edward, who finds himself tossed around like a stick caught in a whirlpool.  Still, he’s having a blast.</p>
<p class='action'>Jenny grabs both his hands, and they spin wildly.</p>

<p class='action'>And then it gets worse.</p>
<p class='action'>The trees ahead are moving.  At first, it just seems to be the wind blowing the branches, but as we hear the wood CRACKING and GROANING, there’s no mistaking it:  they’re trying to block him.</p>
<p class='action'>Snake-like WHITE ROOTS shoot out of the ground, grabbing for his ankles.  He leaps up, kicking off one tree trunk to grab another one’s branches.  He swings off, lands and rolls.  Now all the trees are moving to block him, their dark shapes towering over him in the flashes of LIGHTNING.</p>

<p class='action'>Scrambling forward, he looks for a way out.  But the trees have encircled him, their spiky crowns bending down to crush him.</p>
<p class='action'>He SCREAMS up at the night, until his breath is gone.</p>

<p class='action'>The two make eye contact.  And as they do, all motion FREEZES.</p>
<p class='action'>A fiery baton remains mid-twirl, flames locked in place.  A spilled box of popcorn hangs in mid-air, each kernel like a snowflake.  Even the elephant is mid-poop.</p>

<p class='character'>AMOS</p>
<p class='dialogue'>Every month you work for me, I’ll tell you one thing about her.  That’s my final offer.</p>
<p class='action'>Edward shakes Amos’s hand before he can retract the offer.  We move into a MONTAGE:</p>
<p class='scene-heading'>INT.  BIG TOP CENTER RING - NIGHT</p>
<p class='action'>CLOSE ON Edward, smiling nervously.  His head is tilted to the side, and as we PULL BACK, we see why:  he’s holding it in a MASSIVE LION’s open mouth.  The beast’s sharp teeth are just poking his skin.  If the lion so much as flinches, Edward is dead.</p>
<p class='action'>The CROWD applauds, which makes the lion antsy.  Which makes Edward antsier.</p>
<p class='character'>EDWARD (V.O.)</p>
<p class='dialogue'>From that moment on, I did everything Mr. Calloway asked, and a lot of things he didn’t.  I’d go three days without stopping to eat, and four days without sleeping.</p>

<p class='action'>Edward wrestles with the beast, its mouth snapping at his throat.  Blocking with an arm, Edward tries to push himself free, but the creature’s hands -- it has hands instead of paws -- hold on tight.</p>
<p class='action'>Entwined, they roll across the dirt.  The other nearby CARNIES scatter for cover.   Mr. Soggybottom pulls a revolver out of his clown suit.  Loads a silver bullet.</p>

<p class='action'>Like magic, the dog’s whole demeanor changes.  It bounces excitedly, ready to play fetch.</p>
<p class='action'>Seeing an opportunity, Edward throws the stick as far as he can.  The dog bounds after it,</p>

<p class='character'>EDWARD (V.O.)</p>
<p class='dialogue'>A hitch in the Army was up to three years at that point, and having waited three years just to meet Sandra, I knew I couldn’t survive being away from her that long.  So I took every hazardous assignment I could find, with the hope of getting my time down to less than a year.</p>

<p class='action'>He lands with a CLANG on the lighting catwalk above the stage.  He barely grabs on, disconnecting his chute just as the curtain goes up.  Edward looks out at the sea of excited soldiers.  Every one of them would kill him.  He’s the legless cricket left on the anthill.</p>
<p class='scene-heading'>EXT. ON STAGE</p>
<p class='action'>The curtain rises to reveal PING (27) at a microphone.  She’s as gorgeous a woman as you’ll ever see.</p>
<p class='action'>She stands with her hips turned in profile.  Her body is a knockout, dress cut to reveal skin.  The soldiers are on their feet, WHISTLING and HOLLERING.</p>
<p class='action'>UP ON THE CATWALK, Edward is surprised by an ENEMY SOLDIER.  The two men begin to SCUFFLE.</p>

<p class='action'>SIAMESE TWINS.</p>
<p class='action'>Her identical twin is JING, who’s been singing harmony all this time.  They are two separate women who join at the waist, one set of perfect legs beneath them.</p>

<p class='action'>on the sheet in front of her.  She freezes, watching the shadow ripple across the white fabric, blowing so softly in the breeze.  She knows it can’t be him.  He’s dead.</p>
<p class='action'>She turns away.  With all the strength she can gather, she hangs up that dress and digs another one out of the basket.</p>

<p class='dialogue'>You have to understand.  When I was growing up, he was gone more than he was here.  And I started thinking -- maybe he has a second life somewhere else.  With another house, another family.  He leaves us, he goes to them.  Or maybe there is no family.  Maybe he never wanted a family.  But whatever it is, maybe he likes that second life better.  And the reason he tells all those stories is because he can’t stand this boring place.</p>

<p class='dialogue'>You tell lies, Dad.  You tell amusing lies.  Stories are what you tell a five-year old at bedtime.  They’re not elaborate mythologies you maintain when your son is ten and fifteen and twenty and thirty.  And the thing is, I believed you.  I believed your stories so much longer than I should have.  And then when I realized that everything you said was impossible -- everything! -- I felt like such a fool to have trusted you.  You were like Santa Claus and the Easter Bunny combined.  Just as charming and just as fake.</p>

<p class='action'>Suddenly, an underwater shape RIPPLES against the water’s surface.  Will is so startled that he drops the pole, which disappears into the murky water.</p>

<p class='action'>On a low platform, Edward pitches a brilliant new product to the crowd.</p>
<p class='character'>EDWARD</p>
<p class='dialogue'>I’ve travelled from Tennessee to Timbuktu, and if there’s one thing people have in common, is we could all use a hand around the house.</p>
<p class='action'>Edward sets down a contraption, which looks something like a metal lava lamp.  Like a flower, it unfolds to reveal five fingers and a thumb.  This is the Hand Around the House.(TM)</p>
<p class='character'>EDWARD</p>
<p class='dialogue'>Why, with this product you can...</p>
<p class='action'>QUICK MONTAGE as he demonstrates:</p>
<p class='character'>EDWARD</p>
<p class='dialogue'>Open a jar.  Open a letter.  Scratch yourself while wearing mittens.  Hold a book.  Hold a baby.  Hold the dog away from kittens.  It’s strong enough, you can do a handstand with no hands at all.</p>
<p class='action'>Indeed, a remarkably agile Edward is able to support his entire weight on it.  The crowd APPLAUDS.</p>
<p class='character'>EDWARD</p>
<p class='dialogue'>You can use it to point out important information.  Or dangers.  Or beautiful women.</p>

<p class='dialogue'>That’s great, Norther.  I’m happy for you.  I can’t believe I helped.</p>

<p class='dialogue'>Would you mind grabbing that?</p>

<p class='character'>NORTHER WINSLOW (CONT’D)</p>

<p class='action'>The TELLER WOMAN nods.</p>
<p class='action'>ANGLE ON Edward, not sure what to do.  He has a gun, but he truly doesn’t want to shoot Norther.  The Teller Woman is already waving him to the back.</p>

<p class='character'>NORTHER WINSLOW</p>
<p class='dialogue'>Sixty.  Eighty.  Four hundred dollars!   Not bad for just the drawers.  Let’s see what you got from the vault.</p>
<p class='action'>Edward winces, but doesn’t say anything yet.  Digging through the vault bag, Norther is surprised to find only a single deposit envelope.  He rips it open, revealing just a little cash inside.  Even some dimes and pennies.</p>

<p class='dialogue'>This is it?  The whole vault.</p>

<p class='character'>EDWARD (V.O.)</p>
<p class='dialogue'>I told Norther about the vagaries of Texas oil money and its effect on real estate prices, and how lax enforcement of fiduciary process had made savings and loans particularly vulnerable.  Hearing this news, Norther was left with one conclusion:</p>

<p class='action'>No choice, Edward stops the car.  Puts on the handbrake.  Just as suddenly, the sound changes -- no longer pounding, but softly SPLASHING.  The world is close and echoing, because --</p>
<p class='scene-heading'>EXT.  EDWARD’S CAR - NIGHT</p>
<p class='action'>-- the car is underwater.  The tires are still on the road, but where there used to be air is water.</p>
<p class='action'>Three catfish swim in front of his headlights.</p>
<p class='scene-heading'>INT.  THE CAR - NIGHT</p>
<p class='action'>Realizing his plight, Edward tries to remain calm.  Water is trickling in through the crack between the window and the door, but very slowly.  For now, he’s fine.</p>
<p class='action'>That’s when he sees her -- The Girl in the River.</p>
<p class='action'>She’s swimming outside the car.  While we never see her face exactly, she remains just as beautiful, just as mysterious, as the first time we saw her.</p>

<p class='action'>The inside is nicer than you’d think, a real home.  A fire burns in the stove, and curtains hang in the windows.</p>
<p class='action'>With her back turned to him, Jenny Hill plays the piano.  Edward doesn’t recognize her as the little girl who used to have a crush on him.  Without turning, she says...</p>
<p class='character'>JENNY</p>
<p class='dialogue'>You must be Edward Bloom.</p>
<p class='character'>EDWARD</p>
<p class='dialogue'>How did you know?</p>
<p class='action'>She keeps PLAYING.</p>
<p class='character'>JENNY</p>
<p class='dialogue'>No one would come out here unless they had business.  And no one would have business with me except for you.  You’re buying the town.</p>
<p class='page-break'>109.</p>
<p class='character'>EDWARD</p>
<p class='dialogue'>Apparently I’ve overlooked this one piece of it, and I’d like to remedy that.  You see, in order for the town to be preserved, the trust must own it in its entirety.</p>
<p class='character'>JENNY</p>
<p class='dialogue'>So I’ve heard.</p>
<p class='character'>EDWARD</p>
<p class='dialogue'>I’ll offer you more than it’s worth.  And you know you won’t have to move.  Nothing will change except the name on the deed, you have my word.</p>
<p class='action'>Jenny stops playing, her piece not quite finished.  She turns to face him.  Edward still doesn’t recognize her.</p>
<p class='character'>JENNY</p>
<p class='dialogue'>Now let me get this straight.  You’ll buy the swamp from me, but I’ll stay in it.  You’ll own the house, but it’ll still be mine.  I’ll be here, and you’ll come and go as you please to one place or another.  Do I have that right?</p>
<p class='action'>Strange to hear it put that way, but --</p>
<p class='character'>EDWARD</p>
<p class='dialogue'>In so many words, yes.</p>
<p class='character'>JENNY</p>
<p class='dialogue'>Then I don’t think so Mr. Bloom.  If nothing is going to change, I’d just as soon it not change in the way it hasn’t been changing all this time.</p>
<p class='character'>EDWARD</p>
<p class='dialogue'>It’s not like you’re going to lose anything.  You can ask anyone in town.  I’ve been nothing if not generous.  I want the best for everyone.</p>
<p class='action'>A long beat.</p>
<p class='page-break'>110.</p>
<p class='character'>JENNY</p>
<p class='dialogue'>Mr. Bloom, why are you buying this land?  Some sort of midlife crisis?  Instead of buying a convertible, you buy a town?</p>
<p class='action'>He looks at her, puzzled and surprised.  No one has really asked before.</p>
<p class='character'>EDWARD</p>
<p class='dialogue'>Helping people makes me happy.</p>
<p class='character'>JENNY</p>
<p class='dialogue'>I’m not convinced you should be happy.</p>
<p class='character'>EDWARD</p>
<p class='dialogue'>I’m sorry.  Have I offended you?</p>
<p class='action'>She finally turns to face him.</p>
<p class='character'>JENNY</p>
<p class='dialogue'>No, you did exactly what you promised.  You came back.  I was just expecting you sooner.</p>

<p class='action'>Edward pulls the door shut behind him as he leaves, but it breaks off in his hands.  It’s not the clean exit he was hoping for.</p>
<p class='action'>Inside Jenny looks out, surprised and annoyed.</p>
<p class='action'>Edward tries to lift the door back on the hinges, but they SNAP off.  The door frame buckles and the whole shack CREAKS.</p>
<p class='character'>EDWARD</p>
<p class='dialogue'>I’m sorry.</p>
<p class='action'>He tries to lean the door against the frame, but it keeps slipping.</p>
<p class='character'>JENNY</p>
<p class='dialogue'>It’s okay, just leave it.</p>
<p class='character'>EDWARD</p>
<p class='dialogue'>I can get it.  I can just...</p>

<p class='action'>We STAY ON Jenny, watching him go.  She’s furious, but there’s something more in her feelings for him.  Something softer.</p>

<p class='action'>THE LOVELY HOUSE</p>
<p class='action'>we saw before.  It’s tiny and white, with black shutters and a steep roof.  A white picket fence.  In every detail it is impossibly charming.</p>

<p class='scene-heading'>INT.  JENNY’S HOUSE - DAY</p>

<p class='character'>EDWARD</p>
<p class='dialogue'>Of course, the best part was creating new material.  By the time the twins and I got to Havana, we had a whole new routine worked out for them, with just a ukulele and a harmonica.</p>
<p class='action'>Finished with his work, he takes his hat off the chair and hangs it on the rack.  Perfect.</p>
<p class='action'>A beat.  A look between them.  With that last job done, there’s no reason for him to be staying any longer.</p>

<p class='dialogue'>You can leave it there.</p>
<p class='action'>A beat.  Does she really mean it?</p>

<p class='character'>EDWARD</p>
<p class='dialogue'>No.</p>

<p class='scene-heading'>INT.  JENNY HILL’S KITCHEN - PRESENT DAY</p>
<p class='action'>Will and Jenny are still sitting at her table, a pitcher of iced tea between them.</p>
<p class='character'>WILL</p>
<p class='dialogue'>Logically, you couldn’t be the Witch, because she was old back when he was young.</p>
<p class='character'>JENNY</p>
<p class='dialogue'>No, it’s logical if you think like your father.  See, to him, there’s only two women:  your mother and everyone else.</p>
<p class='character'>WILL</p>
<p class='dialogue'>You didn’t become crazy.</p>
<p class='character'>JENNY</p>
<p class='dialogue'>Well, therapy.  And one day I realized I was in love with a man who could never love me back.  I was living in a fairy tale.</p>
<p class='action'>Will smiles to hear it called that.</p>
<p class='character'>JENNY (CONT’D)</p>
<p class='dialogue'>People aren’t like they are in stories.  They hurt each other without meaning to.  They are kind and unbelievably cruel at the same moment.  Like me, now.  I’m not sure I should have told you any of this.</p>
<p class='action'>Her composure is starting to break.</p>
<p class='character'>WILL</p>
<p class='dialogue'>No, I wanted to know.  I’m glad I know.</p>
<p class='action'>A long beat, both staring at their iced tea.  Jenny is working herself into more of a state by not talking.</p>
<p class='character'>JENNY</p>
<p class='dialogue'>I wanted to meet you for the longest time.  I did.</p>
<p class='parenthetical'>(a smile)</p>
<p class='dialogue'>I envied you so much.  The way Eddie would talk about you when you were at Missouri, that award you won.  Congratulations, incidentally.  And when you got the job at the A.P.</p>
<p class='character'>(MORE)</p>
<p class='page-break'>116.</p>
<p class='character'>JENNY</p>
<p class='dialogue'>, everything, he was so proud of you.  I mean, that’s the thing.  Every moment he loved you.</p>
<p class='action'>She’s fighting tears, not the first ones she’s shed over this.</p>
<p class='character'>JENNY (CONT’D)</p>
<p class='dialogue'>And as brightly as the sun would shine when he was with me, every time he left it disappeared.  I wanted to be as important to him as you were, and I was never going to be.  I was make-believe and his other life, you, were real.</p>
<p class='action'>ANGLE ON Will, sorting through his swirling thoughts.</p>

<p class='scene-heading'>INT.  GUEST ROOM - DUSK</p>
<p class='action'>Looking over his shoulder, we see his father’s bed is empty.  The sheets are in a tangle on the floor.</p>
<p class='action'>A beat, then Will half-runs back down the hall.  Back down the stairs.</p>
<p class='scene-heading'>INT.  FOYER - DUSK</p>

<p class='scene-heading'>INT.  HOSPITAL ENTRANCE - NIGHT</p>

<p class='dialogue'>Is he going to be okay?</p>
<p class='action'>A beat.  How can she answer?</p>

<p class='dialogue'>I loved it.  It sounds peculiar, but I loved every minute of it.  I did.  Eddie was travelling a lot, so he was gone, but I felt like I always had a piece of him with me.  A little part of  his soul inside me.  I could feel it.  It was alive and kicking.</p>
<p class='action'>Sandra has accidentally evoked a storm of emotion.  She struggles to keep it in check.  Almost a whisper...</p>

<p class='dialogue'>No.</p>
<p class='character'>DR. BENNETT</p>
<p class='dialogue'>Your mother came in about three in the afternoon.  Her neighbor drove her, on account of your father was on business in Wichita.  You were born a week early, but there were no complications.  It was a perfect delivery.  Now, your father was sorry to miss it, but it wasn’t the custom for the men to be in the room for deliveries then, so I can’t see as it would have been much different had he been there.  And that’s the real story of how you were born.</p>
<p class='action'>A long silence, just the sounds of the hospital, doctors being paged.</p>
<p class='character'>DR. BENNETT (CONT’D)</p>
<p class='dialogue'>Not very exciting, is it?  And I suppose if I had to choose between the true version and an elaborate one involving a fish and a wedding ring, I might choose the fancy version.  But that’s just me.</p>

<p class='action'>He cracks his neck, crooked from sleeping on it wrong.  What woke him up?</p>
<p class='action'>He looks to his right.  Holds his gaze for a breath.</p>
<p class='character'>WILL</p>
<p class='dialogue'>Dad?</p>
<p class='action'>His father is awake, silently GASPING for breath.  His eyes are open, scared and confused.</p>

<p class='character'>WILL (CONT’D)</p>
<p class='dialogue'>What can I do?  Can I help?  Can I get you something?  Water?</p>

<p class='dialogue'>I don’t know that story, Dad.  You never told me that one.</p>
<p class='action'>Will pushes his fingers under his father’s heavy hand, and holds it.  There’s nothing else to do.</p>

<p class='action'>Rounding a corner, they nearly crash into Dr. Bennett.</p>
<p class='character'>DR. BENNETT</p>
<p class='dialogue'>Will!  I...What are you doing?</p>
<p class='action'>Before he can answer, Will spots Edward rolling the chair himself, pumping both arms.  Will dashes to catch up with him.</p>
<p class='action'>The Heavyset Nurse leans out of Edward’s hospital room.</p>
<p class='character'>NURSE</p>
<p class='dialogue'>Security!  Stop them!</p>

<p class='character'>EDWARD</p>
<p class='dialogue'>No time to explain!  Follow us!</p>
<p class='action'>Seeing SECURITY GUARDS heading their way, a quick-thinking Sandra shoves a nearby cart into them, bowling them down.</p>

<p class='action'>Will sets him in the passenger seat.</p>
<p class='character'>EDWARD</p>
<p class='dialogue'>Water.  I need water.</p>
<p class='action'>Scrambling in back, Will finds a liter of Arrowhead.  Hands it off.  Edward unscrews the cap, but instead of drinking it, he douses himself.  Soaks the blanket.</p>
<p class='action'>Will pops the trunk.  Starts to fold up the wheelchair.</p>
<p class='character'>EDWARD (CONT’D)</p>

<p class='dialogue'>The River!</p>
<p class='action'>Will stops short, the traffic backed up.  He HONKS, trying to get around the jam.  But it’s no use.</p>
<p class='action'>Then, up ahead, the cars start moving, shoved aside by massive hands.  It’s Karl the Giant, clearing a path by brute force.</p>
<p class='action'>Edward leans out the window and waves.  Karl waves back.</p>
<p class='scene-heading'>EXT.  ASHTON RIVER - DAY</p>
<p class='action'>The same stretch of the river where it all began.  A CROWD of more than 100 waiting.</p>
<p class='character'>WILL (V.O.)</p>
<p class='dialogue'>As we get closer to the river, we see everybody’s already there.  And I mean everybody.</p>
<p class='action'>Amos Calloway is here with the circus folk, including Mr. Soggybottom.  We also find Edward’s Mother and Father, the Mayor, and many others from along the way.  No one has aged a day since we saw them last.</p>
<p class='action'>While Ping scans the horizon, Jing nuzzles with her boyfriend, Norther Winslow.  It’s Ping who first spots the Chevrolet.</p>
<p class='character'>PING</p>
<p class='dialogue'>He’s here!</p>
<p class='action'>The crowd CHEERS.  The Ashton marching band PLAYS.  Jenny Hill smiles.  So does the Old Woman.</p>

<p class='character'>EDWARD</p>
<p class='dialogue'>Story of my life.</p>
<p class='scene-heading'>EXT.  RIVERSIDE - DAY</p>
<p class='action'>Will gets out of the Chevrolet, overwhelmed by the crowd.  Behind him, Sandra, Josephine and Dr. Bennett pull up.  Karl comes just after that.</p>
<p class='action'>Crossing to the passenger side, Will lifts his father out.  Strangely, he’s gotten even lighter.  Will carries him easily.</p>
<p class='action'>Edward pulls off his shoes, tying the laces together.  He hands them to Josephine.  She throws them up at the powerline.  They loop over.  APPLAUSE and CHEERS.</p>
<p class='action'>The crowd parts to let Will and Edward get to the river.  As he passes, Edward shakes some hands, pats some people on the cheek, and gives others a good poke in the ribs.</p>
<p class='character'>WILL (V.O.)</p>
<p class='dialogue'>And the strange thing is, there’s not a sad face to be found.  Everyone’s just so glad to see you, and send you off right.</p>
<p class='action'>Will walks into the river, up to his knees.  He turns back so his father can face the crowd.  Edward waves.</p>
<p class='character'>EDWARD</p>
<p class='dialogue'>Goodbye everybody!  Farewell!  Adieu!</p>
<p class='character'>THE CROWD (VARIOUS)</p>
<p class='dialogue'>Goodbye Edward! / See ya! / We’ll miss you!</p>
<p class='action'>But one face is missing from the crowd -- Sandra.  Will turns to see she’s already standing in the river beside them.</p>
<p class='action'>The reflection of the light off the water gives Sandra an unearthly glow.  She’s more tranquil and more beautiful than we’ve ever seen her.</p>
<p class='character'>EDWARD</p>
<p class='dialogue'>My girl in the river.</p>
<p class='page-break'>129.</p>
<p class='action'>She kisses him.  He tweaks her chin.  The crowd HOLLERS in approval, but their moment remains strangely private.  Only Will is there to witness.</p>
<p class='action'>As the kiss ends, Edward tries to pull off his wedding ring.  But it’s stuck.  Finally, he sucks on it, pulling it free with his teeth.</p>
<p class='action'>A look to Will, a smile with a glint of gold.  Will takes the ring out of his mouth.</p>
<p class='action'>Edward suddenly drops out of Will’s arms with a SPLASH.  For he’s no longer a man, but rather</p>
<p class='action'>A FAT CATFISH</p>
<p class='action'>swimming at his feet.</p>
<p class='action'>We watch as the catfish circles, then heads for deeper water, disappearing.</p>
<p class='action'>Will and his mother stand knee-deep in the water, watching Edward Bloom swim away into the sunlight.  Josephine is back on the shore, along with the entire crowd.</p>
<p class='action'>MUSIC BUILDS to a climax, then...</p>
<p class='action'>Down the river, a GIANT FISH suddenly jumps out of the water, cutting a beautiful arc across the sunset.  It then dives back under with a SPLASH.</p>
<p class='transition'>CROSSFADE BACK TO:</p>

<p class='dialogue'>And that’s the way it happens.</p>
<p class='character'>EDWARD</p>
<p class='parenthetical'>(a whisper)</p>
<p class='dialogue'>Yes.  Exactly.</p>
<p class='action'>Edward smiles, proud of both of them.   His eyes are so pale and so open, we can almost see his soul.  In every atom of his body, in every thought, Edward Bloom is entirely happy.</p>
<p class='page-break'>130.</p>
<p class='action'>And this is how he goes.</p>
<p class='scene-heading'>INT.  HOSPITAL HALLWAY - DAY</p>
<p class='action'>Will shuts the door to his father’s room behind him.  The walk to the payphones seems to take a lifetime.</p>
<p class='action'>He finds a quarter, starts to dial.  He has to squint to see through the water in his eyes.   It’s ringing.  And ringing.  The other end answers.</p>
<p class='character'>WILL</p>
<p class='parenthetical'>(voice cracking)</p>
<p class='dialogue'>Hi.</p>
<p class='action'>That’s all he can get out before the dam breaks inside him.  He presses closer to the phone, trying to shield himself.</p>
<p class='action'>MUSIC begins that will carry us through the next passage.</p>
<p class='scene-heading'>INT.  HOSPITAL RECEPTION - DAY</p>
<p class='action'>Will waits at reception as Sandra and Josephine come off the elevator.</p>
<p class='scene-heading'>INT.  GUEST ROOM - DAY</p>
<p class='action'>Josephine opens the curtains, letting white sunlight in.  She strips the bed.</p>
<p class='scene-heading'>INT.  BEDROOM - DAY</p>
<p class='action'>Will and his mother pick out one of Edward’s ties, for Will to wear at the funeral.  Will tries to button the cuffs on the shirt he borrowed, but they’re the kind that need links.</p>
<p class='action'>He goes through the top drawer of the dresser, trying to find a matching pair.  Further down, he finds a ribbon tied to</p>
<p class='action'>THE KEY TO THE CITY.</p>
<p class='action'>He smiles, disbelieving.  It’s a real thing.</p>
<p class='page-break'>131.</p>
<p class='scene-heading'>EXT.  CEMETERY / ROAD - DAY</p>
<p class='action'>Will helps his mother out of a black sedan.  She’s well-composed, not nearly the wreck we might have expected.</p>
<p class='action'>Josephine hugs Dr. Bennett and shakes hands with his WIFE.  The service is crowded, more than 200 people, many more than expected.</p>
<p class='action'>As his mother talks to a WELL-WISHER, Will looks left to see an Oldsmobile parking.</p>
<p class='action'>CLOSE ON the license plates.  Missouri.</p>
<p class='action'>The passenger side opens, but the man who steps out is barely visible over the door.  He shuts it to reveal himself to be 70.</p>
<p class='action'>It’s Amos Calloway.  Will doesn’t recognize him.</p>
<p class='action'>The Driver climbs out, a size 15 foot on the gravel.  We TILT UP to see this man is huge.</p>
<p class='action'>This man is KARL, now 55.  He’s not 12 feet tall, but at least six-eight.</p>
<p class='action'>CLOSE ON Will, bewildered to see that this man really exists.</p>
<p class='scene-heading'>EXT.  CEMETERY / GRAVESIDE - DAY</p>
<p class='action'>As the service gets ready to begin, Will guides his mother to a seat near the grave.</p>
<p class='action'>Sitting beside Will, Josephine spots a stunning ASIAN WOMAN (50) behind them.  A beat later, an identical face with glasses peers out -- the woman’s twin sister.</p>
<p class='action'>It’s PING and JING.</p>
<p class='action'>Josephine almost GASPS.  She elbows Will, who turns to look.  From this angle, the sisters seem conjoined, but then Jing steps forward.  They’re really two separate people.</p>
<p class='action'>A sea of familiar faces, all of them aged through the years:  BEAMEN, NORTHER WINSLOW, the MAYOR, and ZACKY PRICE.</p>

<p class='scene-heading'>EXT.  CEMETERY - DAY [LATER]</p>
<p class='action'>After the service, we see the crowd gathered in small groups.  By the LAUGHTER and hand gestures, we can see they’re telling stories.  They’re telling Edward’s stories.</p>
<p class='action'>We find Will watching them.</p>
<p class='character'>WILL (V.O.)</p>
<p class='dialogue'>Have you ever heard a joke so many times you’ve forgotten why it’s funny?  But then you hear it again and suddenly it’s new.  You remember why you loved it in the first place.</p>

<p class='dialogue'>See.  So he was a giant but my grampa was going to fight him because he wasn’t afraid of anything because he’d seen how he was going to die in this old lady’s glass eye...</p>

<p class='action'>Will smiles as his son continues the tale, which FADES.  Sandra takes Will’s hand in hers, just listening.</p>
